# Machine-Learning-and-Content-Analytics
We will work with a Kaggle dataset that refers to Booking.com reviews and the objective of the project is to perform a sentiment analysis. The analysis will be done on a balanced dataset and metric of interest is the accuracy. We will compare different models and we will keep the best one. The input of the model will be a Booking.com review and the output will be the probability of it being positive.
The initial dataset, the test dataset and files needed to load the best model will be provided seperately.

In this repository you will find the following:
1) A Jupyter Notebook named Data Preparations % Logistic Regression that contains the code for all the preliminary work on the data & a Logistic Regression Analysis
2) A Jupyter Notebook named NLP_LSTM that contains the code for an LSTM model created
3) A Jupyter Notebook named Transformers_PreTrained that contains the code where we used a Pre Trained model
4) A Jupyter Notebook named Transformers_Fine_Tune_PreTrained that contains the code were we expaned the Pre Trained model analysis to improve its accuracy
5) A Jupyter Notebook named How_to_load_the_final model that contains the code for loading the best model. In order for this code to run you will need a zip folder that contains the necessary files/checkpoint. This will be provided seperately.
6) A pdf file with the Final Report
